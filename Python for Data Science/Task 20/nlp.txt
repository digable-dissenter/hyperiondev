Compulsory Task 2

I work for an asset management company. Our company's aim is to gain a competitive edge by offering superior 
investment products that yield better returns than our competitors. Our philosophy is to first determine a company's intrinsic value over time
and ensure that the price we buy a share for is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value.
One application of NLP could be to analyse various unstructured texts for insight generation, for example customer/employee reviews, Federal government filings, etc. for 
sentiment analysis.
Another could include looking at other types of publicly available data, for e.g. Census statistics, coverage and product offerings of competitors
to determine the viability of investing in a particular company (as opposed to its competitors).
These decisions would assist the analysts and portfolio managers' buy decisions based on whether they believe the company's share price
is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value.
