Task 3

American Century Investments is prominent global asset management company.

They use a Natural Language Processing model to aid in reserach in order to detect for possible deception in company's quarterly earnings reports. 
The model is sophisticated enough that it can detect omission of key details, exaggerated claims, verbose explanations of simple concepts, and deflecting 
accountability for poor performance. 
Their NLP model incorporated insights from psychology and computational linguistics and applied these to listed entities in the Russell 3000 index.
Investment manager decisions on portfolio selection would naturally favour companies with a faviourable score according to its model.
