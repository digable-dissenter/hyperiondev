Task 3
1. To plagiarize is to falsely present another person's work, ideas & thoughts, and/or words as your own.
Plagiarism describes the act of doing so as if it were your own doing without crediting the original author.
#(Hyperion Plagiarism Policy Document, 2021)

2. The 4 types of plagiarism are:
a) Direct plagiarism - classic example of submitting someone else's work as your own and not crediting original author.
Example: after a comedian hears a joke at a comedy club and adds it to his routine without acknowledging the first person who told that same joke.
b) Self plagiarism - not realizing that you are presenting work that you have already submitted in the past.
Example: a term paper about Shakespeare that you wrote the previous year.
c) Mosaic plagiarism - combining work from multiple sources without crediting them.
Example: writing a research paper and not referencing the source authors in your list of references.
d) Accidental plagiarism - unintentionally passing off someone else's work as your own.
Example: collecting notes from a business meeting with several other stakeholders and presenting them to your department
