# ================== What is Pseudocode? ==================
# An algorithm is a step by step method for solving a problem.
# Pseudocode is a detailed yet informal description of what a computer program or algorithm must do.
# It is a simple way of writing programming code in English and does not obey any specific syntax rules.
# Syntax is basically the “spelling and grammar rules” of a programming language.
# Pseudocode is easy to write and understand even if you have no programming experience.
# You simply need to write down a logical breakdown of what you want your program to do.

# Take a look at some the examples of pseudocode below


# ************ Example 1 ************

# An algorithm that prints out passed or failed depending on whether a student's grade is greater than or equal to 50:

# if grade is equal to or greater than 50
#       print "passed"
# else
#       print "failed"


# ************ Example 2 ************


# An algorithm that asks a user to enter their name and prints out "Hello, World" if their name is "John":

# request user's name
# if the inputted name is equal to "John"
#       print "Hello, World"


# ************ Example 3 ************


# An algorithm that requests an integer from the user and prints "fizz" if the number is even or "buzz" if it is odd:

# request an integer from the user
# if the integer is even
#       print "fizz"
# else if the integer is odd
#       print "buzz"


# ================== A Quick Note on Variables ==================
# In a program, variables act as a kind of “storage location” for data
# They are a way of naming or labelling information, so that we can refer to that particular piece of information later on in the program.
# For example, say you what to store the age of the user so that the program can use it later.
# You can store the user's age in a variable called “age”.
# Now every time you need the user's age, you can use the variable “age” to reference it.
# As you can see variables are very useful when you need to use and keep track of multiple pieces of information in your program.
# This is just a quick introduction to variables, you will get a more in depth explanation later on in this course.


# ================== Input and Output ==================
# Input is data or information that is transferred to the computer.
# Input is sent to the computer using an input device, such as a keyboard, mouse or touchpad.
# Output is information that is transferred out from the computer, such as anything you might view on the computer monitor.
# Output is sent out of the computer using an output device, such as a monitor, printer or speaker.

# Take look at the pseudo code example below that deals with multiple input and output


# ************ Example 4 ************ 

# An algorithm that asks a user to input their name, and then stores the name in a variable called 'name'.
# Subsequently, the algorithm requests input from the user. If the input does not match 'name', it stores the incorrect
# names in a list until correct name is entered, and then prints out the correct name and the incorrect names:

#        request input from the user
#        store input into variable called name      (i.e. name should equal to input)
#        request second input from the user
#        if the second input is equal to name
#             print out the correct name and the incorrect inputs (which should be none at this point)
#        if the second input is not equal to name
#            request input until second input matches name
#        when second input matches name
#            print out name
#            and print out all incorrect inputs.
