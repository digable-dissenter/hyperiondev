Best to use Visual Studio Code as the IDE of choice to run this program.
When run in IDLE, an Attribute error occurs trying to access one of the functions in the PyInquirer library:
Python AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fileno'
When run in PyCharm, the error reads: No Windows console found. Are you running cmd.exe?
Visual Studio Code provides no such error provided you have the PyInquirer library installed: 
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org pip pyinquirer

Also important when installing the library above to navigate to where your Python interpreter in stored:
for example, C:\Users\Kenneth\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39
