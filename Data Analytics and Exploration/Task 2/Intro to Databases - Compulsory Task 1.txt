Task 1: Introduction to Databases

1. 
	a) Data is raw, unprocessed facts, in most case later to be made meaning of when processed into information (HyperionDev, 2021).
	b) A field is used to store and define data. It consists of a character or group of characters from which meaning can be derived (HyperionDev, 2021).
	c) A record is a logically grouped set of one or more fields that describes an entity (i.e. person, place, etc.) (HyperionDev, 2021).
	d) A file contains related records organised in a collection (HyperionDev, 2021).
	
2. A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software program that manages and accesses data stored in a database. It provides an interface from which a user
   can query the contents of a database by receiving application requests and translating them into complex operations (HyperionDev, 2021).

3. Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts. Information conversely processes data to derive meaning (HyperionDev, 2021).

4. Metadata is data that describes the characteristics of data. In other words, it is data about data (OpenDataSoft, 2016).

5.
	e) 4 records
	f) 5 fields: PROJECT_CODE, PROJECT_MANAGER, MANAGER_PHONE, MANAGER_ADDRESS, PROJECT_BID_PRICE
