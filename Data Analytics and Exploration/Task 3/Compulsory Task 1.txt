Compulsory Task 1: Design and Build Relational Database

	a) Database normalization involves the process of evaluating and correcting table structure in a database in order to eliminate 
	   data redundancies and data anomalies (HyperionDev, 2021).
	b) A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) when:
		- all of the key attributes have been defined
		- no repeating groups exist in the table
		- all attributes are dependent on the primary key (HyperionDev, 2021).
	c) A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) when it:
		- is in 1NF
		- includes no partial dependencies (HyperionDev, 2021).
	d) A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) when it:
		- is in 2NF
		- contains no transitive dependencies (HyperionDev, 2021).
